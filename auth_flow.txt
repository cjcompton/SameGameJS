redirect flow:

user types /auth
get user's id, guild id, and current channel id
post that info to auth server, auth server saves to db for 1? day
samegame bot returns link to auth page with ?id=userid
id is saved in localStorage
state is generated and appended to discord oauth2 link
user is immediately redirected to discord oauth2 link
user authenticates app
user is redirected to auth redirect page with state & access code
client validates state with itself
access code is exchanged with discord for access token
access token & refresh token are sent to auth server to be stored in db for later use
auth server checks if id in localStorage exists & exists in db & matches access token
if yes, auth server creates button with deeplink to server+channel via:
discord://discordapp.com/channels/SERVERID/CHANNELID
if no, auth server just displays a "done! close this window." page
user is now authenticated
